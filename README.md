# Full-Stack-App-Demo
A demo repository for a MERN stack application to demonstrate CRUD functionality and API integration.
To upload a file or folder to GitHub, you can follow these steps:

First, ensure Git is installed on your computer, and you have a GitHub account. Begin by creating a repository on GitHub by clicking the "New Repository" button. Name the repository, add a description if desired, and choose to make it public or private. Once created, copy the repository URL.

Next, on your local computer, organize the files and folders you want to upload. Open a terminal or Git Bash, navigate to the folder containing your files using the cd command, and initialize a Git repository with git init. Then, stage the files for upload by using git add ., which adds all files and folders to the staging area. After staging, commit the files with git commit -m "Initial commit" to create a snapshot of your changes.

Now, link your local repository to the GitHub repository by adding the remote URL using git remote add origin <repository-URL>. Finally, push the files to GitHub with git push -u origin main, which uploads all the committed changes to your GitHub repository. If the repository's default branch isn't main, replace main with the appropriate branch name.

Alternatively, you can use GitHub Desktop for a more user-friendly experience. After installing and signing in, add your local folder as a repository, commit the changes, and publish it directly to GitHub.

For those preferring the GitHub web interface, create a repository and use the "Add file" > "Upload files" option. Drag and drop the files into the upload area, or browse to select them manually. Note that GitHub doesnâ€™t allow direct folder uploads, so if you need to upload a folder, compress it into a .zip file first.

By following these steps, you can upload files or folders to GitHub, making them accessible and shareable with others.
